# what is shell scripting?
>> Shell scripting is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks. A shell is an interface that interprets, processes, and executes these commands from the shell script. It can be particularly helpful to automate repetitive tasks, helping to save time and reduce human error. 

### Types of Shells:

    Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
    Zsh (Z Shell)
    Ksh (Korn Shell)
    Tcsh (Tenex C Shell)

>> A shell script is a text file containing a series of commands that the shell can execute. It typically has a .sh extension.

## Creating and Running a Simple Shell Script:
1. Create a new file: Use a text editor like nano, vi, or gedit to create a new file. Name it example.sh.
2. Add the shebang line: The first line of the script should be #!/bin/bash to specify that the script should be run with Bash.
3. Add commands: Write some simple commands. For example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Make the script executable: Change the file's permissions to make it executable.
```
chmod +x example.sh
```
6. Run the script: Execute the script by typing:
```
./example.sh
```
